## [LIVE PREVIEW](https://leonas734.github.io/product_customiser/html/product-customiser/index.html)

## Quickstart

1. Check if your computer has npm and NodeJS installed using `node -v` `npm -v`. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Install project packages using the `npm install` in the same directory as the package-lock.json file. 
3. Duplicate .envexample, rename to .env and update all database values accordingly.
4. Run `npm run three` for frontend only or `npm run server` for full stack application.

## Building static / to Github Pages
1. GITHUB PAGES ONLY: Set `PRODUCTION` variable to `"true"` inside the .env file
2. `npm run build` - builds static page
3. Copy over the house model folder `/models` to the `/dist` folder that was generated by `npm run build`.
4. GITHUB PAGES ONLY : Push the built folder to Github pages.`git add dist -f`, `git commit -m "Adding dist"`, `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
5. Preview on local machine - only works if PRODUCTION is set to `"false"` - before `npm run build` command is ran.
